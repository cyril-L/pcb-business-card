## Notes

- 54 x 86 mm PCB area
- Fits nicely in a card holder with a PCB thickness below 1 mm
- Silkscreen areas might not look very good when made by the cheapest manufacturers
- Manufacturer might add an order id on the PCB, check if you can disable it or specify its location
- Try a small batch before making hundreds of them
